# Zed Cylc Extension

This extension adds support for `.cylc` and `suite.rc` workflow configuration files to the [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) code editor.

> [Cylc](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow) (pronounced silk) is a general purpose workflow engine that also manages cycling systems very efficiently. It is used in production weather, climate, and environmental forecasting on HPC, but is not specialized to those domains.

It uses the grammar defined in [tree-sitter-cylc](https://github.com/elliotfontaine/tree-sitter-cylc).
